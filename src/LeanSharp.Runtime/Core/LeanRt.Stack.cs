// Stack overflow detection.
//
// Natively a stack overflow in compiled Lean code hits the guard page; Lean's signal handler
// prints "Stack overflow detected. Aborting." and aborts the process. A .NET stack overflow cannot
// be caught and terminates the OS process, which here may host many Lean programs (a test
// worker, Lake with its in-process `lean` children). So the generated code checks the stack
// itself: `lean_stack_probe()` is emitted at the start of every function that can be part of a
// recursion (and in `lean_apply_N`, through which every recursion via closures passes), and when
// the stack of the thread is nearly used up the program ends like the native one: the message on
// its standard error and exit status 134 (128 + SIGABRT), as an `IO.Process.exit` that unwinds
// the thread.
