// Global state of the compiled Lean code, per logical process.
//
// The Lean libraries keep their global state in `IO.Ref`s created by `builtin_initialize`
// (registered options and attributes, environment extensions, the search path, the "importing"
// and "run initializers" flags, ...). Natively every program (`lean`, `lake`, each `lean` child of
// Lake) runs in its own OS process and finds that state as module initialization left it.
// LeanSharp initializes the compiled modules once per OS process and runs many programs in it,
// some of them concurrently, so the *values* of those refs are kept per logical process:
//
//  * a ref created while the host initializes the compiled modules gets a slot number;
//  * when initialization is complete (`LeanProgramState.FreezeInitialState`) the values are made
//    persistent and become the initial state of every program;
//  * afterwards reads and writes of such a ref go to the slot of the current logical process
//    (`LeanLogicalProcess.Globals`, a copy of the initial state made on first use).
//
// Refs created later (by a program) are ordinary objects.
